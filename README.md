In short, the game unfolds within three rows, each consisting of three columns. Randomly timed enemy hexagons appear from the right side, outside the screen, traversing a row towards the left side of the screen. Once a hexagon completes its journey across the entire row, the player loses a life . If the player loses three lives, the game is lost.

To counter the evil hexagons, the player has the ability to place a saving rhombus in one of the three cells on each row. The rhombus launches projectiles that travel to the right along the row where the launching rhombus is placed. Upon encountering a hexagon, the projectile inflicts damage, and after three successful hits, the hexagon disappears, saving the situation for a moment .

However, the player faces two drawbacks. They cannot place as many rhombuses as they wish, as each placed rhombus costs a certain number of stars. Stars appear at random intervals on the screen, and the player must collect them. Additionally, each rhombus can only damage a specific type of hexagon, based on the color of each.

Are you ready to help the player defeat the "evil" hexagons?

Second Game: World_of_tanks (simplified)

The game takes place on a horizontal plane containing tanks and buildings. The objective of the game is for the player's tank to destroy as many enemy tanks as possible within the limited time. For each destroyed tank, the player earns points. Tanks can move forward, backward, and rotate their turret. To target enemies, the tank turret can be rotated by mouse. Projectiles are launched from the top of the cannon and move rectilinearly and uniformly for a certain duration until they hit buildings or tanks. Each tank withstands a minimum of 3 projectile hits. The more damaged the tanks are, the more deformed and blackened they will be drawn.

Enemy tanks will move on the map on a random path . Enemy tanks rotate their turrets in the player's direction to shoot projectiles at them, if it is close enough.

The game ends either when the time limit is reached or when the player's tank is destroyed. If the time limit is reached, the score will be displayed in the console. The accumulated score is considered only if the game time has expired. If the player's tank is destroyed, an appropriate message will be displayed in the console.
